## Making Updates

When planning to make a change to any of the files in this repo:

* First check to see if there are any open PRs before creating a branch
* If there are no open PRs, create a branch, push it to origin, and open a PR with a list of changes you plan to make
* Make changes to the Sketch files, push to your branch, and let the team know before merging the changes to master

This will be a somewhat manual, one change at a time workflow (which is probably ok given the frequency of updates to these files)
